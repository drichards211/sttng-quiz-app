##Trivia App for Star Trek: The Next Generation

> A live version of the app is located [here].(https://drichards211.github.io/sttng-quiz-app/)

This is a fun quiz-style web app for fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It utilizes jQuery to dynamically update the DOM, and JavaScript to keep track of the score and player ranking. The CSS styling is extensive: it seeks to simulate the experience of operating a live computer terminal aboard the Enterprise NCC-1701-D.

Upcoming features include sound effects for button clicks, correct and incorrect answers.

##Bugfixes:
* [ ] Legend text doesn't correctly "text-align: right" in Firefox.
* [ ] Fixed side-bar element needs to be thinner on smaller viewports
* [ ] Font is too small on some viewports
