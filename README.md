> A live version of the app is located here: (https://drichards211.github.io/sttng-quiz-app/)

This is a fun quiz-style web app for fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It utilizes jQuery to dynamically update the DOM, and JavaScript to keep track of the score and player ranking. The extensive CSS styling simulates the experience of operating a live computer terminal aboard the Enterprise NCC-1701-D.

Upcoming features include sound effects for button clicks, correct and incorrect answers.
