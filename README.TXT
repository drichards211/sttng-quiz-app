RESUBMISSION:

I've implemented ALL of the reviewer's suggested changes, with the exception of one: The use of all-caps text. 

Capital letters absolutely decrease legibility. Unfortunately, there are no lowercase computer fonts available in the 24th century. I would consider this to be a limitation of the genre. Anyone familiar with Star Trek would consider lower-case letters to be a mistake.

The font used is the actual production font for the TV show... it's not an approximation. In order to increase readability, I have manually increased the letter-spacing and word-spacing in the CSS. It's a small change, but it definitely helps with readability. I've also made sure it renders nice and large on all displays, including 320px.

Thank you for the excellent feedback; I've worked hard to implement all of the suggestions completely into the design.

-D.R.
